# Hard Times

Version 1.0: 2023.11.05

A warning about upcoming events, for which we should prepare URGENTLY.

We will talk about three topics:
* Economic disaster
* Pollution
* Famine

This information is taken from intuitive sources and common sense.

**To improve your intuition, we recommend:**
* lead a healthy lifestyle
* study spiritual practices: yoga, qigong
* praise the Gods and <ins>not ask for</ins> anything from them even in hard times.

Modern people have too binary thinking: everything will be either fine or a complete apocalypse. Why then prepare? But the truth is in the middle. More advanced type of thinking: probabilistic.
An ancient saying: hope for the best and prepare for the worst.

This message will not prove that hard times are approaching. Use your intuition or look for analogies from history. The message is made to make it easier to prepare for upcoming events at home. Preparation products are provided as examples.

When everyone understands that Hard Times have come, one of the extremes is either despair or panic. As in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, students said: “Why should we study if a nuclear war is coming soon?”. As the news dramatizes everything and store shelves get empty, monitor your emotions, hard times are always temporary.

We do not know the dates and how long the Hard Times will last.
Patience and hardening: remember how a small child asks every 5 minutes when we will arrive. Or how many of us were whining when the pandemic would end.

<ins>We are sure that the Pandemic, Financial Catastrophe, World War, Pollution and Famine are events of a single chain</ins>. And the tougher this chain is, the faster it will end and the recovery period will begin.

It is necessary to psychologically tune in to Hard Times and be patient.

The gods do not test us more than we can bear.

We do not discuss who is to blame for Hard Times, <ins>the maximum focus is on overcoming difficulties</ins>.

If inner anger, fear, despair or impatience increases, we recommend Taoist exercises - [Inner Smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2tAXVAP5rA) and [Six Healing Sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_jq5tfOm0w) ([Inner Smile and Healing Sounds](https://www.mantakchia.com/inner-smile-and-healing-sounds/)). 

We rely <ins>only</ins> on ourselves; in Hard Times, governments will be overloaded with maintaining infrastructure and military operations.

Let's focus on preparing for non-standard events.

## Economic disaster

We emphasize that there will be no crisis, but an economic catastrophe.

The easiest scenario is the 2008 crisis multiplied by three. But we are sure that most likely there will be an analogue of [the Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) in the USA in the 1930s, only on a global scale.

**An economic catastrophe can be divided into several points:**
* Sharp collapse of stock exchanges. Financiers will start going out the window and bankers will shout that this is the end of the world.
* Mass bankruptcy of companies. Both small businesses and large factories and corporations will go bankrupt.
* Total bankruptcy of banks.
* After the acute phase of the crisis, the unemployment rate will begin to rise. At its peak, we estimate an unemployment rate of 35% in Western countries and up to 40% in the Asian region.
* The modern economy is heavily dependent on the Internet. Therefore, the likelihood of damage to backbone Internet cables is very high. Internet clubs where they will accept food stamps as payment might appear. 

#### Preparation:

– [Bank Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run)
You should urgently withdraw cash from bank accounts. Because not only banks will go bankrupt, but also deposit guarantee funds (EDIS, FDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). For example, the American Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the right to return funds for 20 years!

– **Diversification**

Diversification - don't put all your eggs in one basket.

You should prepare cash reserves for 2-3 years of life. Select currencies according to your region. General currency distribution scheme: 70% in USD, 30% in EUR or GBP.

If you have more money, you can buy gold bullions, but store it not in safe deposit boxes, but only at home. But we must remember that they may introduce a ban on the physical trade in gold ([Executive Order 6102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102)) and even introduce [criminal liability for the storage of gold by individuals](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/a-dangerous-precedent-executive-order-6102/).

You can also purchase non-perishable goods that may be useful in Hard Times for sale/exchange.

– **Cost minimization**

Give up expensive purchases, enter economical mode. Buy only what will help you overcome Hard Times.

We expect mass strikes and riots, people losing their jobs. Strikes will be brutally [suppressed](https://www.military.com/military-life/6-times-military-was-used-suppress-civilian-uprisings-us.html) by the army and police.
<br />

## Pollution

We are sure that many regions of the Earth will face environmental pollution. From London and Vancouver to Beijing.

The type of pollution will likely vary greatly by region. For example, Eastern Europe is exposed to radiation pollution due to a disaster/terrorist attack at a nuclear power plant. It is important to consider that an “incident” can occur not only at Zaporizhzhya NPP.

Western Europe has a higher chance of chemical/biological terrorist attacks.

After the Hard Times, we expect the greatest pollution in China.

It is important to note that many pollutions are not a death sentence and are not a reason to evacuate the population. Even in the Chernobyl exclusion zone there are many places where the radiation level is lower than in megacities. And after Hard Times, a period of recovery always begins. The rapid development of water and soil purification startups is possible.

A single incident with oil can take up to one year to resolve; imagine the scale of pollution during massive industrial disasters.
In addition to humidity and temperature, the weather forecast will talk about the level of radiation or pollution.

In case of a radiation release, the main thing is to wait in a shelter/at home for 5-7 days (if the government has not announced an evacuation in your region). After five days, the radiation level drops a hundred times. The main danger is radionuclides (dust) that enter the human body through inhalation or water/food.

Let us consider such scenarios:

#### Possible causes of pollution:
* Biological/chemical terrorist attacks.
* [Dirty bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiological_warfare), [Cobalt bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_bomb), [Salted bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_bomb).
* Disasters/accidents/terrorist attacks at factories, [railways](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/15/us/toxic-chemicals-train-derailments-explainer/index.html), nuclear power plants.
* Consequences of hostilities.
* Extensive fires and smoke.
* [Unusual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl) natural disasters.

#### Preparation:

– **Informational resources**:

* [windy.com](http://windy.com) you can track in which direction the air masses are moving.
* [radmon.org](https://radmon.org) is not government radiation monitoring.
* [iaea.org](https://www.iaea.org) International Atomic Energy Agency.
* [nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) the site visualizes the destruction and contamination of the area for different types of warheads directly on a map. The visualization clearly shows that nuclear bombs are not that scary and everything can be handled.

– Prepare an "**emergency backpack**" for emergency evacuation.

– **Gas masks and respirators**. The respirator must have protection against aerosols FFP3 and an exhalation valve:
* [3M](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/c/ppe/respiratory-protection/disposable/) paper/cloth respirator can be worn for a long time if cleaned.
* [3M 7500](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/dc/v000057592/) + HEPA filters [3M 6035](https://www.3m.com.ua/3M/uk_UA/p/d/v000077057/)

– **Emergency supplies of water and easy/instant food** for at least two weeks, wrapped in plastic.

– At least one **radiation meter** per family ([GQ GMC-300S](https://www.gqelectronicsllc.com/comersus/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=5786)).
Up to 0.30 µSv/h (microsieverts per hour) is normal. There are regions where granite slabs come to the surface, there is natural background radiation up to 0.80 µSv/h and people live there for many generations. But if you record a level higher than 0.30 µSv/h, you need to find out the reason. Use the dosimeter in a zip bag to prevent radioactive dust from getting on the body.

– **Water purification**

Water filters can be stationary with an ion exchange membrane. Also jugs with cartridges. There are various filter [comparisons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeRGnHuYol8) on the Internet.
We recommend stocking up on water filters for at least 2 years.
[Zeolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeolite) enterosorbent filters radionuclides well.

– **Vitamins, Iodine and dietary supplements**

For any contamination, it is recommended to take vitamins since the body is subject to stress. In case of radiation contamination, it is recommended to take potassium iodide. But potassium iodide should be taken with caution, as it has many side effects and allergies. There are dietary supplements with a high iodine content.

If you are not in a 30-kilometer zone, then potassium iodide can be taken once (100 mg for an adult), and in subsequent days take dietary supplements in the form of pressed brown algae, spirulina and other iodine-containing products.

– **Enterosorbents**

[Enterosorbents](https://www.uatom.org/ru/2019/07/24/chernobylskaya-aptechka.html) help bind and remove heavy metals and radionuclides.
The most famous is natural Zeolite. It can be taken as a dietary supplement or used as a water filter.

– **Protective clothing when going outside:**

* In case of radiation contamination, it is necessary to protect your feet from dust. [Disposable shoe covers](https://rozetka.com.ua/bahili/c4644376/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-pyqBhDmARIsAKd9XINU-jMHteHIYT5SEUTdx38zFiwZRmvGG7miPPQs9pYnfgCkUZEhNekaAgpbEALw_wcB), but better - reusable knee-high shoe covers [1](https://mishutki.com.ua/p1686118663-bahily-vysokie-sadovye.html?source=merchant_center&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-pyqBhDmARIsAKd9XIPvLRTKGEC8vjx_aRgCE1WT6C9LirDoiV7_pQW8WFdzQGq_nBdComgaAlsbEALw_wcB), [2](https://kyivziz.com.ua/ru/specodezhda/kombinezony-kratkosrochnogo-ispolzovaniya/3m-450/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-pyqBhDmARIsAKd9XINnhMnkMyR4x-_ZDkxVXCuIJ4odce7eIabh11s6e4DPfjNseBrKJYUaAs-NEALw_wcB&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_vdalo&utm_term=&utm_content=) or [PVC shoe covers for shoes](https://coolnice.com.ua/vitrina/chehlyi-bahilyi-pvh-dlya-obuvi-ot-dozhdya-coolnice-belyie-vyisokie/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-pyqBhDmARIsAKd9XIPTRUFOOQrZVvoh32lZMdoAWAChQ5bAXnIWz4nq0ELNicTYwbeXeLYaAkk5EALw_wcB). Reusable shoe covers can be left outside the door.
* Protect your hair with scarves.
* When radiation is released into the atmosphere, radiation rains often occur. You must carry a plastic raincoat with you.
* After returning home, measure the radiation level of your hands, shoe covers and hair.

#### Associated potential hazards:

* the government may delay announcing the accident.
* forced mobilization to eliminate consequences without means of protection.
* panic of people (wave of evacuation).
* shortage of clean food (in the long term).
* increased crime/looting rates and increased penalties for looting.
* seizure of equipment and food products by the military.

– **Inventories**

In general, stock up on everything you regularly buy in stores, pharmacies, and the Internet. Temporary shortages are possible for any product.

* Clothes and shoes
* Make supplies of personal hygiene products for two years: soap, washing powder, etc.
* garbage bags, paper towels, wet wipes (lots of them), tooth powder.
* Medicines, make extra glasses for the visually impaired.

– **Additional Information**

* ["Chernobyl" first aid kit](https://www.uatom.org/ru/2019/07/24/chernobylskaya-aptechka.html)

#### Our protocol for a radiation accident

Protocol in case you are not in the 30-kilometer zone, otherwise there will most likely be an evacuation. Many items are also suitable for chemical/biological contamination.

1. As soon as they found out that there is an increased level of radiation in the city, warn relatives and friends, everyone immediately goes home.
1.1 When outside, immediately protect your respiratory organs with a scarf.
1.2 When you get home, measure the radiation of your outer clothing and shoes; if it is above 0.30 µSv/h, place the clothing in a sealed trash bag.
1.3 take a shower.

2. Turn off the room ventilation system.
3. Listen to the radio: should you take iodine? The closer to the epicenter, the faster you need to take it. It is better to take the tablet with clean food.
4. Fill a bath of water, useful for technical purposes.
5. Buy in the store everything you might need to stay at home for a week.
6. Seal all windows and ventilation with wide tape.
7. Wrap all food, kitchen utensils, and water tightly in film.
8. Wide oilcloth can be used to cover cabinets and beds.
9. Prepare long cloth or gauze to cover the windows that will be opened for ventilation. Carefully cut the tape on the window, moisten the cloth with water, open the window in ventilation mode and throw a wet cloth on top to filter dust.
10. Carry out only wet cleaning in the room; the most dangerous thing is radioactive dust.
11. Check the radiation level of everyone who enters the room: hands, feet, head. If an increased background is detected, you can repeat the shower.
12. Wipe products with a damp cloth before unpacking.
13. Distribute individual respirators that can be signed.
14. Pray.

<br />
## Famine

Let us immediately clarify that we expect full-blown famine (even to the point of cannibalism) in Africa. In Europe and North America there is unlikely to be a famine, but there will be <ins>food shortages</ins>. When there is a food shortage, the first thing governments will do is introduce food stamps. It is also possible for food to be confiscated from farmers by the "government".

Residents of the post-Soviet countries remember how in the 1990s they introduced food stamps, washing powder, etc. We expect the temporary introduction of food stamps in many countries around the world.

Western countries may have a more equitable distribution of Supply Packs. But in the UK the situation can be complicated by the fact that much of the food supply is supplied through the Eurotunnel, which can be vulnerable to attack.

There is a high risk of famine in Taiwan in the event of a blockade of the island.

Food stamps will <ins>temporarily</ins> become a currency, and black markets will appear for the sale/exchange of coupons and goods. Let us remind you that trade and exchange of alcohol/cigarettes may not be conscientious.

[Bread Line](https://www.google.com/search?q=bread+lines+great+depression) - In the USA, during the Great Depression, there was a shortage of food in big cities. There were long lines at charities for a bowl of soup.

In Ukraine, in the Donetsk region, there was a remarkable story. The young couple made fun of their grandmother, who, according to the old school, made a lot of preserves. Indeed, why preserve it if there are supermarkets and vegetable stores. Then, when the war began, they hid in the basement for six months and survived due to these conservations. And there are indeed a huge number of such stories when people were saved in extreme conditions thanks to home canning.

One of the markers of the approaching famine was that in August 2023, India introduced [a ban on rice exports](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/28/business-india/india-rice-ban-export-farmers-loss-intl-hnk-dst/index.html).
When Hard Times come, most countries will begin to ban food exports. Even now, when walking around your supermarket, pay attention to what percentage of products are imported into your country.

<ins>By stocking up on food, we give up our place in line for rations.</ins>

We don’t know when famine will begin, so we recommend storing long-lasting food items, for at least two years. There are many videos on the Internet on how to store flour for 10 years and cereals for 15 years.

#### Possible reasons for product shortages

1. Military operations on the main sea trade routes.

2. Ban on food exports by countries (all countries will impose restrictions on food [exports](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/28/business-india/india-rice-ban-export-farmers-loss-intl-hnk-dst/index.html)).

3. High cost of products. Due to the economic crisis and shortages, many people will not be able to buy enough food.

4. Environmental and man-made disasters/terrorist attacks. Eastern Europe - radioactive contamination of soil and food warehouses. In the USA - chemical soil pollution.
China has massive soil and water pollution.

5. Panic buying of food.

6. Abnormal weather events (especially in the USA - [Dust Bowl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl)).

7. Mass death of [bees](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/all-bee-colonies-in-switzerland-are-sick--warns-specialist/48832802).

8. Fuel shortage will lead to problems with sowing.

9. Plant diseases.

10. Insect/locust infestation.

11. Increased volcanic activity.

12. Numerous evacuations of people (especially the Indo-Asian region).

13. During martial law, food will be issued using coupons. Chaw Tickets, Supply Packs.

#### General recommendations for food preparation

– For long-term storage of cereals, there are vacuum packers [CASO FastVac 500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSxQ__iinOk). Vacuum packers require special corrugated [CASO 27,5x600cm](https://coyot.ua/rulon-dlya-vakuumatora-caso-275x600cm-2-sht/).
You can also throw a few bay leaves and salt in a bag into a vacuum bag.
Also [traditional methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIeNgvOdxGg).

– We recommend making large reserves of green buckwheat. When buckwheat is sprouted, the amount of vitamins increases many times over. A family of four needs 12 kg of buckwheat per month.

In second place is oatmeal because it has a lot of protein. Rice contains a lot of carbohydrates.

– Flour for 5+ years.
1. Sift the flour with a sieve.
2. Place 3 bay leaves at the bottom of a 10-liter plastic bottle.
3. Fill the flour halfway and add three cloves of unpeeled garlic.
4. Add flour to the top and add three more bay leaves.
5. Screw the bottle tightly. You can also fill the lid with wax.

– We highly recommend stocking up on concentrated vitamins. As survivors say, when choosing: one tablet of vitamins or a kilogram of pasta, we definitely choose vitamins.
We provided a complete list of vitamins in the section “Pollution -> Vitamins, Iodine and dietary supplements”. Here we repeat the basics for nutrition:
* [Multivitamins](https://ua.iherb.com/c/multivitamins)
* [Vitamin B Complex](https://ua.iherb.com/c/vitamin-b-complex) (especially for vegetarians)
* [Vitamin D](https://ua.iherb.com/c/vitamin-d)
* [Vitamin C](https://ua.iherb.com/c/vitamin-c)

<br />
## Additions

* Make a local backup of all important files, books, movies, music, photos. Because there may be long Internet outages.
* Purchase a high-quality radio (Tecsun PL-660) or radio station.
* Means of self-defense: [gas spray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwxsxsGzEXo).
* There are many videos on the Internet on how to prepare and act in case of emergencies and military events.

Follow global news more than local ones, <ins>read between the lines</ins>.  

<br />
## Conclusion

There is a theory that: the apocalypse is an individual phenomenon. If a person cannot remember the last time he heard birds singing, then for him the birds have already fallen silent. If he can’t remember when he looked at the stars, then for him the stars have already gone out...

There is no need to run and shout what is coming. Most will not believe it, but remaining silent on the quiet may also be unconscionable. You can simply say: I am preparing and I recommend it to you.

In Hard Times, the main thing is not to lose your human nature.
We have a responsibility for our children before the Family.
Blaming anyone is a waste of energy. We need to draw conclusions and continue to follow the golden spiral of evolution.
